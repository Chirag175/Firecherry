# Firecherry
One-Page Website for Firecherry - Mobile Phone Company.
My first assignment. The task was to develop a product catalog and an order form able to directly send order emails.<br/><br/>
I used HTML and CSS primarily along with Bootstrap to design the website fundamentals. Created the logo and image headers through Illustrator and Canva respectively. Then used JavaScript for functionality. As it was my first project, it was challenging and I wanted to do something unique. So, I created those selectors. Through them, you can directly select the product you want from the catalog and it will be added below to then, complete the order.
